# Unit Testing


A nice guide on unit testing in python can be found here: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/

For python, there are several available packages: unittest, pytest, tox, hypothesis, etc.


# unittest and doctest

The `unittest` and `doctest` packages are both built-in as part of the python standard library, so use these for testing code. `unittest` is for testing code whereas `doctest` is for testing docstrings.
