Installing Python
=================

Many modern operating systems come with a python distribution preinstalled.  However, if you are new to python we highly recommend installing a conda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)  distribution.  This will make installing packages and managing different environments down the line much easier.

Under the User guide in the conda documentation, look at the Installation tab (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#).  If you have disk space constraints on your computer, install Miniconda, otherwise choose Anaconda.  Under Regular instillation, select your operating system.

If you have disk space constraints on your computer, install Miniconda, otherwise choose Anaconda.  Follow the installation instructions.  If given the option, choose python 3 as the default version of python.


Running Jupyter Tutorials
=========================

This directory contains two useful tutorials to help you get started with python.

Open a terminal window.

Navigate to this directory with cd command.
	$ cd /path/to/this/directory

Run the following command to start the jupyter server.
	$ jupyter notebook

This should open a tab in your browser where you can see the contents of this directory through a standard file system navigatory.  If you click on 'InstallPython.txt', you should see this text file!

To try runing a tutorial, click on either GetStartedWithPython.ipynb or GetStartedWithJupyter.ipynb.

This should run one of the tutorials, letting you try out python and jupyter notebooks.  Feel free to start your own notebook to try it out or simply modify one of the exising notebooks and see how it changes!

When you are done, use Control-C in the terminal window to exit the server.
